# StoryHub

**StoryHub** is a simple and intuitive blogging platform built using Django and HTMX. This project was developed as a practice exercise to gain proficiency in using HTMX with Django to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Leveraging HTMX, the blog platform enables dynamic loading of content without requiring full page reloads. This provides a seamless and responsive user experience.

- **Post Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts with ease. The post list updates dynamically as changes are made, thanks to HTMX.

- **Commenting System**: Blog posts include a commenting feature where users can add and view comments in real-time. The comments section updates dynamically as new comments are added.

- **Category and Tag Support**: Posts can be categorized and tagged, allowing for better organization and filtering of content.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for posts by title or content, with the search results displayed dynamically as they type.


## Technology Stack

- **Django**: The core framework used for developing the backend of the application, managing the database, and handling server-side logic.

- **HTMX**: A lightweight JavaScript library used for enhancing the front-end by enabling dynamic interaction with the server without needing full page reloads.

- **SQLite**: A simple, file-based database used for development purposes. This can be easily swapped out for a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL in production.


## Purpose of the Project

This project was created primarily for educational purposes to practice and demonstrate the integration of HTMX with Django. It showcases how modern web development techniques can be used to create responsive, user-friendly applications.
